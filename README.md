I created four vehicles, two off-road vehicles inspired by a Menyoo mod and two with 10 and 20 seats respectively. I recreated them from scratch without Menyoo as a proof of concept. All seats are functional.

**Attention**, in the current state of the code it is indeed necessary to reload the script each time you get into one of these vehicles to activate the car props.
not at all optimized, not at all crash free, contribution greatly accepted
